A GCP account gives access to all of the platform's infrastructure and services. For a new account, trial credits is awarded to be spent over a period of 12 months. This offer allows one to explore the different features and services of Google's cloud offering.

<span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">To register an account requires a valid credit card to validate that it is an authentic user, as opposed to a robot. However, the credit card won't be charged after the trial ends, except Google is authorized to do so.</span>

The Cloud Dashboard provides a birds-eye summary of the project such as the current billing rate and other resource usage statistics. The activity tab to the right gives a breakdown of the resource actions performed on the account. This feature is useful when building an audit trail of events.
