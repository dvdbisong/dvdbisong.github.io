The Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine, simply known as Cloud MLE is a managed Google infrastructure for training and serving “large-scale” machine learning models. This managed infrastructure can train large scale Machine Learning models built with TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn or XGBoost. It also provides modes of serving or consuming the trained models either as an Online or Batched prediction service.
