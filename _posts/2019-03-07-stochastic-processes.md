Stochastic processes is a tool for describing random systems changing over time.

Example of important processes:
- Brownian motion,
- Markov chains,
- Gaussian processe,
- Poisson processes and many others

We'll learn about selecting the appropriate type of processes for modeling in particular situations.

Next we'll understabd:
- Notions of Ergodicity,
- Stationarity, and
- Stochastic Integration.
