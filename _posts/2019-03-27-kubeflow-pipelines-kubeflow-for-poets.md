Kubeflow Pipelines is a simple platform for building and deploying containerized machine learning workflows on Kubernetes. Kubeflow pipelines make it easy to implement production grade machine learning pipelines without bothering on the low-level details of managing a Kubernetes cluster.

Kubeflow Pipelines is a core component of Kubeflow and is also deployed when Kubeflow is deployed.

## Components of Kubeflow Pipelines
A Pipeline describes a Machine Learning workflow, where each component of the pipeline is a self-contained set of codes that are packaged as Docker images. Each pipeline can be uploaded individually and shared on the Kubeflow Pipelines User Interface (UI). A pipeline takes inputs (parameters) required to run the pipeline and the inputs and outputs of each component.

The Kubeflow Pipelines platform consists of:
- A user interface (UI) for managing and tracking experiments, jobs, and runs.
- An engine for scheduling multi-step ML workflows.
- An SDK for defining and manipulating pipelines and components.
- Notebooks for interacting with the system using the SDK.
