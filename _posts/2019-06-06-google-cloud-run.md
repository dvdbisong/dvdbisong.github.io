excerpt: "Google Cloud Run provides a managed platform for running stateless containers. As the Compute infrastructure is managed, it can auto-scale in response to increased user-traffic. Cloud Run Services receives web traffic via HTTP requests or via asynchronous events, like a Pub/Sub message. This project uses Cloud Run to run a stateless container that employs Pandas profiling to display the summary statistics of a structured CSV dataset."
