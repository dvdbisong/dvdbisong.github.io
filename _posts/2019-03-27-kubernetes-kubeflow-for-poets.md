When a microservice application is deployed in production, it usually has many running containers that need to be allocated the right amount of resources in response to user demands. Also, there is a need to ensure that the containers are online, running and are communicating with one another. The need to efficiently manage and coordinate clusters of containerized applications gave rise to Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is a software system that addresses the concerns of deploying, scaling and monitoring containers. Hence, it is called a *container orchestrator*.  Examples of other container orchestrators in the wild are Docker Swarm, Mesos Marathon and Hashicorp Nomad.

Kubernetes was built and released by Google as an open-source software, which is now managed by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>. Google Cloud Platform offers a managed Kubernetes services called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/">**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**</a>. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kubernetes/">Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)</a> also provides a managed Kubernetes service.

## Features of Kubernetes
- **Horizontal auto-scaling:** dynamically scales containers based on resource demands.
- **Self-healing:** re-provisions failed nodes in response to health checks.
- **Load balancing:** efficiently distributes requests between containers in a pod.
- **Rollbacks and updates:** easily update or revert to a previous container deployment without causing application downtime.
-  **DNS service discovery:** Uses Domain Name System (DNS) to manage container groups as a Kubernetes service.

## Components of Kubernetes
The main components of the Kubernetes engine are the:
- **Master node(s)**: manages the Kubernetes cluster. They may be more than one master node in High Availability mode for fault-tolerance purposes. In this case, only one is the master, and the others follow.
- **Worker node(s)**: machine(s) that runs containerized applications that are scheduled as pod(s).

The illustration below provides an overview of the Kubernetes architecture. Later, we'll briefly go through the individual sub-components.

### Master Node(s)
- **etcd (distributed key-store):** manages the Kubernetes cluster state. This distributed key-store can be a part of the Master node or external to it. Nevertheless, all master nodes connect to it.
- **api server:** manages all administrative tasks. The `api server` receives commands from the user (`kubectl` cli,REST or GUI), these commands are executed and the new cluster state is stored in the distributed key-store.
- **scheduler:** schedules work to worker nodes by allocating pods. It is responsible for resource allocation.
- **controller:** ensure that the desired state of the Kubernetes cluster is maintained. The desired state is what is contained in a JSON or YAML deployment file.

### Worker Node(s)
- **kubelet:** the `kubelet` agent runs on each worker node. It connects the worker node to the `api server` on the master node and received instructions from it. Ensures the pods on the node are healthy.
- **kube-proxy:** it is the Kubernetes network proxy that runs on each worker node. It listens to the `api server` and forward requests to the appropriate pod. Important for load-balancing.
- **pod(s):** consists of one or more containers that share network and storage resources as well as container runtime instructions. Pods are the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

## Writing a Kubernetes Deployment File
The Kubernetes deployment file defines the desired state for the various Kubernetes objects. Examples of Kubernetes objects are:
- **Pods:** a collection of one or more containers.
- **ReplicaSets:** part of the `controller` in the master node. Specifies the number of replicas of a pod that should be running at any given time. It ensures that the specified number of pods is maintained in the cluster.
- **Deployments:** automatically creates `ReplicaSets`. It is also part of the `controller` in the master node. Ensures that the clusters current state matches the desired state.
- **Namespaces:** partition the cluster into sub-clusters to organize users into groups.
- **Service:** a logical group of Pods with a policy to access them.
  - *ServiceTypes:* specifies the type of Service e.g. `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, `ExternalName`. As an example, `LoadBalancer` exposes the service externally using a cloud providerâ€™s load balancer.

Other important tags in writing a Kubernetes Deployment File.
- **spec:** describes the desired state of the cluster.
- **metadata:** contains information of the object.
- **labels:** used to specify attributes of objects as key-value pairs.
- **selector:** used to select a subset of objects based on their label values.

The deployment file is specified as a `yaml` file.

The example in the next sections deploys the nginx server image that was pushed to Dockerhub in the <a href="/docker-kubeflow-for-poets">previous section</a> to a Kubernetes cluster. The image is accessible at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ekababisong/ebisong-nginx-server">https://hub.docker.com/r/ekababisong/ebisong-nginx-server</a>.

### Example of a Service Object
This code snippet of a `Service` object is saved in `kubernetes-intro/deployment.yaml`.
```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-server-service
spec:
  # service applies to the application with name `nginx-server`
  selector:
    app: nginx-server
  ports:
    - protocol: "TCP"
      # port inside cluster
      port: 8080
      # forward to port inside the pod
      targetPort: 80
      # accessible outside cluster
      nodePort: 30001
  # load balance between 5 instances of the container application
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Example of a Deployment Object
This code snippet of a `Deployment` object is saved in `kubernetes-intro/deployment.yaml`.
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-server-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 5
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-server
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx-server
          image: ekababisong/ebisong-nginx-server
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

### Running Webpage on pod orchestrated by Kubernetes
Let's access the application inside the Kubernetes cluster by running <a href="http://192.168.99.102:30001">192.168.99.102:30001</a>. We use the port `30001` because we are accessing the application from outside the cluster.

### Delete the Deployment and Stop Minikube
```bash
# delete the deployment
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
```
```
service "nginx-server-service" deleted
deployment.extensions "nginx-server-deployment" deleted
```

```bash
# stop minikube

## Deploying Kubernetes on Google Kubernetes Engine
To create and deploy resources on GCP from the local shell, the Google Command line SDK `gcloud` will have to be installed and configured. If this is not the case on your machine, follow the instructions at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/">https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/</a>. Otherwise, a simpler option is to use the Google Cloud Shell which already has `gcloud` and `kubectl` (the Kubernetes Command line interface) installed.


### Creating a GKE Cluster
```bash
# create a GKE cluster
gcloud container clusters create ekaba-gke-cluster
```

A Kubernetes cluster is created on GCP with 3 nodes (as default).
