excerpt: "Online communities are a significant part of interactions over the internet. The rise of such communities comes with the need for community moderation to ensure that participants adhere to their prescribed guidelines and avoid “clear and obvious” and objective policy violations. Google Cloud AutoML for Natural Language provides the platform for designing and developing custom language models for language recognition use-cases. This article uses Google Cloud AutoML for Natural Language to develop an end-to-end language toxicity classification model to identify obscene text."
